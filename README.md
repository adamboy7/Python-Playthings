# Python-Playthings
I'm working on learning python and opencv, among other libraries. Probably nothing useful here, but fun!
Shoutout to sentdex for his programming tutorials. He covers a lot of cool stuff like opencv, machine learning, networking, and more.
A lot of what you find in here are his tutorial code (Usually FILLED with my notes), as well as some spin off code using what I learn.
